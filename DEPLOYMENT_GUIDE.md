# 🚀 GitHub Deployment Guide for Daily Wellness Hub

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign into your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `daily-wellness-hub` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: "Healthcare Platform with Wellness Hub, Store, and Hospital Services"
   - **Visibility**: Public (required for GitHub Pages free tier)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Copy the repository URL from GitHub (it will look like: `https://github.com/yourusername/daily-wellness-hub.git`)

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/daily-wellness-hub.git

# Rename main branch to 'main' (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**
5. The workflow will automatically deploy your site

## Step 4: Access Your Live Site

After the GitHub Actions workflow completes (usually 2-5 minutes):

- Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/daily-wellness-hub`
- Check the **Actions** tab to monitor deployment progress
- Look for a green checkmark indicating successful deployment

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If GitHub Pages doesn't work:

1. Check that your repository is **Public**
2. Verify **GitHub Pages** is enabled in Settings
3. Check **Actions** tab for any build errors
4. Ensure the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### If images don't load:

- All images are included in the project and should work automatically
- The build process optimizes and includes all assets

### To make updates:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically redeploy your site
